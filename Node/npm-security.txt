# Security npm notes

## Install only packages versions that are published before specific time

Install packages that were published before a specific date

```
npm install --before=2024-12-01
```

Or use a relative time format

```
npm install --before=5d  # 5 days ago
npm install --before=1w  # 1 week ago
npm install --before=1m  # 1 month ago
```

This is useful to install latest versions that can be checked and tested with no hack attacks

## Good practice, remove caret "^" in versions

```
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "some-package": "1.2.3"  // exact version, not ^1.2.3
     }
   }
```
