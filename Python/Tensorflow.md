# Steps of Machine Learning
- Load in the data
    - X and Y
    - Use to work with Pandas
- Split into Train/Test Sets (Sometimes, example Computer vision)
- Build a model
- Fit the model
- Evaluate the model
- Use it to make predictions

# Machine Learning?
**A Gemoetry problem!**

# Reinforcement learning
Like a loop
Achive a goal

**Elements**
- Agent
- Environment
- Episodes

- State -> Now
- Action -> What to do next
- Reward -> Real number [-n, 0, n]
- Policies

What are the states variables?
What are the actions?
What is the reward?
